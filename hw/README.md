# Truss hardware

## Key components

Documentation for the key components of the truss experiment are included in the [docs](./docs) directory. This includes:

- [Linear actuator](./docs/Actuonix+L16+Datasheet.pdf) for applying load.
- [Load cell](./docs/load-cell.png) for load force measurement ([available here](https://www.loadcellshop.co.uk/load-cell/in-line-load-cells/miniature-in-line-load-cell/))
- [Biaxial strain gauges](./docs/KFGS_kyowa_strain_gauge.pdf) for strain measurement on each beam.
- [HX711](./docs/hx711_english.pdf) ADC for reading from strain gauges.

## CAD

CAD files for the full truss structure are available in the [cad](./cad/) directory.
