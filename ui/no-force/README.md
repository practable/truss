# truss-ui

This version is designed for the Structural Mechanics 2 course, in the School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh.

This version of the UI has many of the same features as the `default` UI, except it does not display the load force nor allow you to tare the load cell. It also does not display theoretical strains.
